let dna = "TCG-TAC-GAC-TAC-CGT-CAG-ACT-TAA-CCA-GTC-CAT-AGA-GCT";

//a) Replace the gene "GCT" with "AGG", and then print the altered strand.



//b) Look for the gene "CAT" with ``indexOf()``. If found print, "CAT gene found", otherwise print, "CAT gene NOT found".



//c) Use .slice() to print out the fifth gene (set of 3 characters) from the DNA strand.



//d) Use a template literal to print, "The DNA strand is ___ characters long."



//e) Just for fun, apply methods to ``dna`` and use another template literal to print, 'taco cat'.
