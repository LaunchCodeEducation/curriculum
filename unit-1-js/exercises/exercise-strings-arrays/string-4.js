let language = 'JavaScript';

//a) Use string concatenation and two .slice() methods to print 'JS' from 'JavaScript'.



//b) Without using .slice(), use method chaining to accomplish the same thing.



//c) Use bracket notation and a template literal to print "The abbreviation for 'JavaScript' is 'JS'."



//d) Just for fun, try chaining 3 or more methods together, and then print the result.
