let dna = " TCG-TAC-gaC-TAC-CGT-CAG-ACT-TAa-CcA-GTC-cAt-AGA-GCT    ";

// First, print out the dna strand in it's current state.


//a) Use the .trim() method to remove the leading and trailing whitespace, then print the result.

console.log(/* Your code here. */);

//b) Change all of the letters in the dna string to UPPERCASE, then print the result.

console.log();

//c) Note that after applying the methods above, the original, flawed string is still stored in dna. To fix this, we need to reassign the changes to back to dna.
//Apply these fixes to your code so that console.log(dna) prints the DNA strand in UPPERCASE with no whitespace.

console.log(dna);
