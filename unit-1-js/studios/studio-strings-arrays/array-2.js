//a) Use split to convert the strings into four cabinet arrays. Alphabetize the contents of each cabinet.



//b) Initialize a cargoHold array and add the cabinet arrays to it. Print cargoHold to verify its structure.



//c) Query the user to select a cabinet (0 - 3) in the cargoHold.



//d) Use bracket notation and a template literal to display the contents of the selected cabinet. If the user entered an invalid number, print an error message.



//e) Modify the code to query the user for BOTH a cabinet in cargoHold AND a particular item. Use the 'includes' method to check if the cabinet contains the selected item, then print “Cabinet ____ DOES/DOES NOT contain ____.”
